  Hi, my name's Conrad and I'm a software developer, with a primary interest in game development. I am currently a student. I taught myself almost everything I know about computer science well before I began college, starting with Game Maker 7 when I was in elementary school.

  I have worked with several Minecraft Marketplace creators as the primary dev on multiple projects, where I learned leadership and communication skills. During my time working on Minecraft Marketplace content I developed a C# library that automates much of the workload, which is still in active development today.

  I am most skilled in C#.

          I started this project during a fit of rage while learning how to create Minecraft addons. A lot of the design decisions made for Bedrock's component based system seemed pretty were irritating to work with, which prompted me to create this library so I wouldn't have to deal with it. Most of my Minecraft development happens with Bedrock.NET and it has grown to a point where multiple developers and studios are using it. There have been 5 projects released on the marketplace either fully or partially developed using Bedrock.NET, with several more nearing the end of development.

          If you've ever played Payday 2 on the highest difficulty you know it's not for the faint of heart. There are a couple skills on the skill tree that are an absolute requirement and new players will sometimes join high difficulty lobbies without realizing what they've signed themselves up for. This mod quickly checks the skill tree of any player that joins and kicks players who are missing certain skills.

          Synchronize RGB effects for G.Skill TridentZ RAM and Corsair Lighting Node Pro.
        description: |
          Since every computer hardware brand wants to have their own RGB software, if you get parts from two different brands you can't really synchronize the lighting effects. Well, since I had G.Skill TridentZ RAM and a Corsair Lighting Node Pro I wrote some software that would leverage the APIs of both brands to create a unified effect. Problem was Asus's API used C# while Corsair's API used C++, so I wound up writing some unmanaged code in a managed language. Learned my lesson about trying that.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
